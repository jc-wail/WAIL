There are two *Audit projects currently in this repository, EnergyAudit and PathAudit.

EnergyAudit is a single network power inference utility that matches a priori measured device snapshots to snapshots of deployed devices, and returns a consumption value. 

PathAudit is a tool which extracts detailed device configuration information end to end network probes. 

Further details and usage are provided in project subdirectories.
